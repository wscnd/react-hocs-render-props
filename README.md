# React HOCS and Render Props

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a playground for me to implement HOCS and [Render Props](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)Â with React+Typescript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
